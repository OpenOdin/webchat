Place here OpenOdin Service JSON configuration files.

All `.json` files are copied from here to `./dist` upon development build and are accessible to be loaded by the application.

The default file used is `app.json`, for any another file load the webchat with the query string `conf=my-app.json` parameter in the URL.
